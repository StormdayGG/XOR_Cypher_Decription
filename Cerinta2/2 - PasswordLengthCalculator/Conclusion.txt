In a large text, it is highly probable that the same 3 letters end up encoded with the same 3 letters of the password multiple times.

Starting from this premise, we check how often each set of 3 adjacent characters shows up in the encrypted file, since it's extremely likely that the vast majority
of the distances will be multiples of the password's length.

From the results, we can tell that the password is highly likely to be 15 characters long.
